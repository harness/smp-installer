### Creates Kubernetes cluster
### For AWS, it creates an EKS cluster 
kubernetes:                       
  manage: true                    # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for kubernetes cluster
  # cluster_name: ""              # Set this to existing cluster if manage is set to false
  version: "1.29"                 # Kubernetes version to create the cluster
  nodes: {}                       # Override nodes configuration according to your needs. By default, installer will set these values based on profile
  #   machine_type: "t2.2xlarge"
  #   initial_nodes: 5
  #   minimum_nodes: 1
  #   maximum_nodes: 5
  #   availability_zones: 2

### Creates loadbalancer
### For AWS, it creates an ALB
loadbalancer:                     
  manage: true                    # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for loadbalancer
  availability_zones: 2           # Number of availability zones to create the cluster in
  # ip: ""                        # Set this if manage is set to false

### DNS related configuration. 
### For AWS, it manages the Route53 configuration. It creates a public zone in route53.
dns:                              
  manage: false                   # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for dns
  domain: ""               # Domain to be used for harness configuration. If empty, installer will use loadbalancer IP to configure endpoints.

### Harness helm chart configuration
harness:
  manage: false
  version: "0.23.1"               # Harness version to be installed
  namespace: "harness"            # Namespace to install harness
  repository:                     # Helm chart repository to fetch chart from
    url: "https://harness.github.io/helm-charts"
  override_files: []              # Existing override files to use for helm chart installation. These files take precendence over auto-generated override file. Their order matters.
  nginx: true                     # Set it to true to configure harness with nginx controller.
  istio: false                    # Set it to true to configure harness with istio. nginx and istio are mutually exclusive.
  ingress_node_port: 32000
  modules:                        # Configure the modules to enable in the chart. 
    cd: true
    ci: true
